  <h1>Lahmacun The Magnificent</h1>
  <img src="/images/lahmacun.jpg" alt="lahmacun" />
  <p>
    Think of Lahmacun, pronounced Lahamajoun, as super thin, crispy pizza
    topped with a flavor-packed mixture of minced meat with peppers, tomato,
    fresh herbs and earthy spices.
  </p>
  <p>
    I take a major shortcut by using quality store-bought pizza dough. But the
    secret is in the <strong>spice mixture!</strong>

  <div class="Instructions"></div>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 450 degrees F (230 C). Adjust oven rack to the middle.</li>
    <li>Prepare the meat mixture. In the large bowl of a food processor, fitted with blade, add red peppers, shallot,
      garlic, and parsley.
      Pulse a few times to chop. To the mixture, add ground lamb. Season with spices and salt. Add tomato paste and
      extra virgin olive oil. Now pulse again until well-combined</li>
    <li>Prepare two large rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper</li>
    <li>Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal balls working with one ball of dough at a time, place on a floured surface
      Using a rolling pin, roll dough out into as thin as you can to a disk that's about 8 or 9 inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Assemble Lahmacun. Place one flatbread disk on one of the prepared pans. Reshape as needed.
      Spoon 3–4 tablespoon topping onto dough and spread topping evenly to edges, leaving a thin boarder.</li>
    <li>Bake in heated oven for about 5 to 7 minutes or until dough and meat are fully cooked</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Squeeze a little lemon juice on top. Serve Lahmacun hot or at room temperature. See notes below for how to
      serve.</li>
    <br>
    <p><em><strong> Tip for How to serve Lahmacun: </strong> Before you serve, squeeze just a little bit of lemon juice
        on Lahmacun. If you like, simply add a few slices of red onion, radish, and fresh mint leaves on top, and wrap
        the Lahmacun up, burrito-style. OR, to serve a larger crowd, you can slice Lahmacun like you would pizza or
        flatbread and serve with a drizzle of tahini sauce and a side of this easy Mediterranean salad.You can add
        favorite mezze.</em></p>
