    <h1>Çiğköfte the Conquerer</h1>
    <img src="/images/cigkofte-photo.jpg" alt="cigkofte"/>
    <p>
    <strong>Çiğköfte is made with very high-quality</strong>, fat-free beef that is minced and kneaded together
    with fine bulgur, pepper, tomato paste, onion, garlic, and a mixture of Turkish spices. 
    It's a regional dish from the southeastern part of Turkey with a lot of history behind it.
    </p>
    <p><i>Due to a higher awareness of food health and more and more stringent regulations, many people today opt for a modern, vegetarian version of this ancient Turkish dish. 
    Some meatless versions of çiğ köfte are so authentic, you can't tell them from the real thing.</i>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the tomatoes and peel them using a small, sharp knife. 
            Place the peeled tomatoes in a food processor and puree them, or finely grate them using a hand grater.</li>
            <li>Rinse the bulgur under cold water in a wire strainer for a few minutes. Drain it and put it in a large mixing bowl along with the tomato puree.
             Mix together well, cover the bowl, and set it aside for about 1 hour until the bulgur is softened.</li>
            <li>Peel and coarsely chop the onions and garlic and put them in the food processor along with the stale bread and the walnut halves.
             Pulverize on high speed until you have a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Add this mixture to the tomato and bulgur along with the pomegranate concentrate, isot biber, tomato paste, red pepper paste, cumin, and salt. 
            Wearing rubber gloves, knead the mixture until all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into portions small enough to fit inside the food processor. Process each portion on medium speed until smooth. 
            Combine all the processed portions together in a large bowl and continue to knead until it has a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Place in a bowl and cover with an airtight seal; set aside for at least 5 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>The next morning, break off bite-sized pieces of the mixture and shape them into fingerprint shapes. 
            Arrange them on a serving plate with parsley, green onion, leaves of Romaine lettuce, and slivers of fresh lemon for squeezing.</li>
        </ol>
