      If you're planning a trip to Turkey, you must put meat-filled dumplings
      topped with garlic yogurt, or mantı, on your to-eat list. If you've
      already been to Turkey, you might have tried this classic dish that's
      loved by adults and kids alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you're not planning a trip to the European country anytime soon,
      you can make the savory dumplings at home. There are many ways to prepare
      mantı, including the popular
      <strong><i>Kayseri mantısı</i></strong> (mantı from the Anatolian city of
      Kayseri). The dish is known for its tiny size and a tangy tomato sauce
      drizzled over the garlic yogurt.

    <div class="Instructions">
      <u><h2>Instructions</h2></u>
      <h3>Make the Dough and Filling</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To make the dough, slowly mix together the flour, salt, and eggs in a
          large bowl with a fork. Slowly knead in enough water to make a firm,
          uniform dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and set it aside at room
          temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make the filling, place the ground beef, onion, parsley, salt,
          black pepper, and optional cumin, mint, and sweet paprika in a medium
          bowl. Mix together until well blended.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Shape the Dumplings</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Divide the dough into two portions and lightly flour a work surface.
          Keep one piece of dough covered while you roll out the second portion
          as thinly as you can using a rolling pin or pasta machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the tip of a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the rolled-out
          dough into small squares about the size of postage stamps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a piece of the filling about the size of a chickpea in the
          center of each square.
        </li>
        <li>
          Starting with the first square, use your fingers to stretch the dough
          a little and pinch together two opposite corners in the center over
          the filling. Then, pinch together the other two corners at the center.
          Your finished dumpling should have a star pattern with all the corners
          pinched together at the center. Repeat this will all the squares.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Make the Broth and Boil the Dumplings</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large saucepan, combine four cups of water with 1 teaspoon salt
          and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. If you're using beef
          bouillon, be careful to check the salt content first. You might not
          need extra salt. You also can add 1 tablespoon each of tomato paste
          and sweet pepper paste to the broth if you wish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add about 10 dumplings to the simmering broth and let them cook for
          several minutes. Cooked mantı will usually float to the top, but test
          one before you decide. The dumplings should be tender but still hold
          together when cooked. Remove with a slotted spoon to individual
          serving bowls and repeat until all the manti are cooked.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Make the Yogurt Sauce and Tomato Sauce</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Crush the garlic cloves and whisk them into the yogurt with a wire
          whisk until creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in a small pan, add the tomato paste, water, and
          optional salt and let the mixture simmer for a few minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Serve the Manti</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Add a few spoons of the cooking broth to each bowl containing the
          manti.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top each bowl of manti with a generous amount of garlic yogurt. Then
          drizzle each bowl with a few spoons of the tomato sauce. If desired,
          garnish with mint, oregano, sumac, and hot pepper flakes.
        </li>
      </ol>
